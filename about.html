                My name is William Reames. I graduated from Christopher Newport University in May 2023 with a Bachelor of Science degree in both Computer Science and Cybersecurity. I have been living in Washington, D.C. while working remotely for IBM as Software Developer since July 2023.

                My current focus is in back-end software development. I particularly enjoy problem solving and being able to creatively think of solutions to problems. Python is the programming language that I enjoy the most, but I am also comfortable working with Java, Bash, MySQL, PHP, C#, and C++.
            </p>

                One of my personal projects that I recently completed was an AI that can play the board game, <i>Hive</i>. This was my capstone project for my Computer Science degree. It required me to program the rules of the game, develop a method of scoring a game state, then implement a minimax algorithm for the AI. It was a lot of fun and I am fairly happy with how it turned out. The project source code can be found 
                    <a href="https://github.com/wdreames/hive_board_game_ai" target="_blank">here</a>. 
                It also contains instructions on how to install and play it yourself if you would like :)
            </p>
            <p>
                Outside of work, some of my hobbies include playing clarinet or piano, board games, spending time in nature, reading, playing video games such as Hollow Knight or Beat Saber, and watching Studio Ghibli movies.
